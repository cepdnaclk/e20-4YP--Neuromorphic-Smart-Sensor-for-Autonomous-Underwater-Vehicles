# Neuromorphic Smart Sensor for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles
___

This paper proposes an integrated system that combines neuromorphic smart sensors, spiking neural networks (SNNs) on embedded GPU platforms (NVIDIA Jetson), and CORS/RTK-based surface buoy positioning to address important challenges in autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) operations. Through event-driven sensing, real-time navigation using tether geometry reconstruction and CORS corrections, and intelligent communication matched to bandwidth constraints, the suggested method achieves continuous, low-power perception. In compari- son to traditional AUV architectures, neuromorphic approaches offer notable advantages in terms of power efficiency, latency, and operational flexibility. We also highlight important research gaps. To measure performance improvements, field validation is suggested.
